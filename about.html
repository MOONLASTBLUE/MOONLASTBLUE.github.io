        <h2>About Yunji</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Yunji.
I am studying Data Science and Information Science, working on various projects in data analysis, machine learning, web development, and data visualization.

I am passionate about solving real-world problems and deriving insights from data. Through my projects, I have gained experience in the entire data pipeline, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and visualization.
I also enjoy building web applications and interactive dashboards to present data intuitively, using tools like Python, SQL, Django, Flask, and Streamlit to develop data-driven services.

My projects focus on business insights, user experience improvement, and health data analysis, leveraging real-world datasets to create impactful solutions.
This portfolio showcases the projects I have worked on, my technical skills, and my approach to solving data challenges.

ðŸš€ I strive to extract meaningful insights from data and develop practical solutions.</p>
